#### Multiplexers
A multiplexer chooses 1 of many inputs to steer to its single output under the direction of control inputs. e.g. if the input to a circuit can come from several places a Mux is one way to funnel the multiple sources selectively to the single output.

This is an 8:1 Mux, which needs 3 control inputs.
