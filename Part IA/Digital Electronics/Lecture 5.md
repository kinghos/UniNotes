Most sequential circuits employ the notion of synchronous operation - the output of a sequential circuit is constrained to change only at a time specified by a global enabling signal (the clock)

If one of the inputs is 0, the output is always 0
Output follows b input if a is 1
The complement function prevents $R=1,S=1$ (illegal avoided)
