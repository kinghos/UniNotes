### Synchronous State Machines
- Finite state machine - a deterministic machine that produces outputs which depend on its internal state and external inputs
- States - The set of internal memorised values shown as circles on the state diagram
- Inputs - External stimuli, labelled as arcs on the state diagram
- Outputs - results from FSM
