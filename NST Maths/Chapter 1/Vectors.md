 $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos \theta$
 $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\sin (\theta)n$

### Equation of shapes
Equation of a sphere: $|r-a|=\rho$ where a is the centre of the sphere and $\rho$ is the radius

Equation of a cylinder: $|r-(r.\hat{n})\hat{n}|=R$ where n is the line between centres of each circle face

Equation of a cone: $|r-q|\cos \alpha$ where q is the vertex and $\alpha$ is the angle at the vertex
