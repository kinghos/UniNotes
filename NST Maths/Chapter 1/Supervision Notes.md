### [[Vectors]]
- $\lambda a + \mu b + \nu c=0$ means that vectors $a,b,c$ are coplanar. It means you can return to the origin with some combination of the 3 vectors. This means they are not linearly independent
- Linear independence can be thought of as "Can you get anywhere in 3D space with some combination of these 3 vectors".
- Eliminating a vector from a set of equations, where the 3 vectors are linearly dependant means the equations can be solved, given that the two vectors are not colinear.
- Just because an equation involves division by 0, does not necessarily mean it is invalid. Look out for $\frac{0}{0}$, as this can occur without being undefined.z
