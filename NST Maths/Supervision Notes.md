### [[Vectors]]
- $\lambda a + \mu b + \nu c=0$ (given $\lambda \neq\mu\neq\nu\neq0$) means that vectors $a,b,c$ are coplanar. It means you can return to the origin with some combination of the 3 vectors. This means they are not linearly independent
- Linear independence can be thought of as "Can you get anywhere in 3D space with some combination of these 3 vectors".
- Eliminating a vector from a set of equations, where the 3 vectors are linearly dependant means the equations can be solved, given that the two vectors are not colinear.
- Just because an equation involves division by 0, does not necessarily mean it is invalid. Look out for $\frac{0}{0}$, as this can occur without being undefined.z

- Try and put planes in the form $r\cdot\hat{n}=k$
- $k=a\cdot \hat{n}$, so $ax+by+cz=\frac{d}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$
- $c\cdot\hat{b}$ is the length of c parallel to b
- $(c\cdot\hat{b})b$ is the vector part of c parallel to b
- $c-(c\cdot \hat{b})b$ is the vector part of c perpendicular to b
- When given equations of shapes, consider restrictions in the axes the object can move, e.g. for the equation for a sphere, how is movement in each plane limited
- Replace $r$ with $r-a$ in equations of shapes to centre at a point other than the origin
